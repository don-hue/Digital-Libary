# Digital-Libary
Part of Odin Proejct

Part of the assignement was to construct a webpage at which a user can input their Books and get a display of their current BookList

As a additional credit I implemented LocalStorage feature.

Dark-Mode and Light-Mode was my personal flavour. 

Firebase that is a Cloud-based storage of Book-List is work in progress.
